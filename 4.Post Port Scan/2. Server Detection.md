Once Nmap discovers open ports, you can probe the available port to detect the running service. Further investigation of open ports is an essential piece of information as the pentester can use it to learn if there are any known vulnerabilities of the service. Join Vulnerabilities 101 to learn more about searching for vulnerable services.

Adding -sV to your Nmap command will collect and determine service and version information for the open ports. You can control the intensity with <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">--version-intensity LEVEL</mark> where the level <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">ranges between 0, the lightest, and 9, the most complete</mark>. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">-sV --version-light</mark> has an intensity of 2, while <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">-sV --version-all</mark> has an intensity of 9.

It is important to note that using -sV will force Nmap to proceed with the TCP 3-way handshake and establish the connection. The connection establishment is necessary because Nmap cannot discover the version without establishing a connection fully and communicating with the listening service. In other words, stealth SYN scan -sS is not possible when -sV option is chosen.

The console output below shows a simple Nmap stealth SYN scan with the -sV option. Adding the -sV option leads to a new column in the output showing the version for each detected service. For instance, in the case of TCP port 22 being open, instead of 22/tcp open ssh, we obtain 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 6.7p1 Debian 5+deb8u8 (protocol 2.0). Notice that the SSH protocol is guessed as the service because TCP port 22 is open; Nmap didn’t need to connect to port 22 to confirm. However, -sV required connecting to this open port to grab the service banner and any version information it can get, such as nginx 1.6.2. Hence, unlike the service column, the version column is not a guess.

Note that many Nmap options require root privileges. Unless you are running Nmap as root, you need to use sudo as in the example above.
