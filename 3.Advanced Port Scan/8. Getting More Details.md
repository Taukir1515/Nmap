	- reason:
		nmap -sS target_IP --reason
			*reason why Nmap concluded that the system is up*
			
	- verbose:
		nmap -sS target_IP -v
		nmap -sS target_IP -vv
		
	- Debugging Details:
		nmap -sS target_IP -d
		nmap -sS target_IP -dd


You might consider adding <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">--reason</mark> if you want Nmap to provide more details regarding its reasoning and conclusions. Consider the two scans below to the system; however, the latter adds --reason.

Providing the --reason flag gives us the explicit reason why Nmap concluded that the system is up or a particular port is open. In this console output above, we can see that this system is considered online because Nmap “received arp-response.” On the other hand, we know that the SSH port is deemed to be open because Nmap received a “syn-ack” packet back.

For more detailed output, you can consider using -v for verbose output or -vv for even more verbosity.

If<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;"> -vv </mark>does not satisfy your curiosity, you can use<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;"> -d </mark>for debugging details or <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">-dd</mark> for even more details. You can guarantee that using -d will create an output that extends beyond a single screen.

- Launch the AttackBox if you haven't done so already. After you make sure that you have terminated the VM from Task 4, start the VM for this task. Wait for it to load completely, then open the terminal on the AttackBox and use Nmap with nmap -sS -F --reason MACHINE_IP to scan the VM. What is the reason provided for the stated port(s) being open?
> syn-ack
