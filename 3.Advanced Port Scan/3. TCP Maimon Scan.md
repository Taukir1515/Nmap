	namp -sM Target_IP

Uriel Maimon first described this scan in 1996. In this scan, the FIN and ACK bits are set. The target should send an RST packet as a response. However, certain BSD-derived systems drop the packet if it is an open port exposing the open ports. This scan won’t work on most targets encountered in modern networks; however, we include it in this room to better understand the port scanning mechanism and the hacking mindset. To select this scan type, use the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">-sM</mark> option.

Most target systems respond with an RST packet regardless of whether the TCP port is open. In such a case, we won’t be able to discover the open ports. The figure below shows the expected behaviour in the cases of both open and closed TCP ports.

The console output below is an example of a TCP Maimon scan against a Linux server. As mentioned, because open ports and closed ports are behaving the same way, the Maimon scan could not discover any open ports on the target system.

This type of scan is not the first scan one would pick to discover a system; however, it is important to know about it as you don’t know when it could come in handy.
